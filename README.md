# DJ Music Selection System

## Description
This is a **rule-based AI system** designed to help DJs select the best songs for their events based on:
- **Event type** (Club, Wedding, House Party, etc.)
- **Preferred genre** (EDM, Hip-Hop, Pop, etc.)
- **BPM range** for smooth transitions
- **Energy level** to match the crowd's vibe
- **Key matching** for harmonic mixing
- **Crowd mood analysis** to adjust music dynamically

This system operates **without machine learning** and relies on predefined rules to generate song recommendations.

## Features
✅ Smart **rule-based song selection**  
✅ Real-time **crowd mood adaptation**  
✅ **User preference tracking** for personalized suggestions  
✅ **BPM & Key Matching** for smooth transitions  
✅ Expandable with **music API integrations** (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music)  

## Installation
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DJ-Music-Selection.git
cd DJ-Music-Selection
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
This project does not require external dependencies. However, ensure you have Python installed.

### **3. Run the Script**
```bash
python dj_music_selection.py
```

## Usage
1. The system will prompt you for **event type, genre, BPM range, and energy level**.
2. It will then **suggest a song** based on predefined rules.
3. Optionally, you can enable **key matching** or consider **crowd mood dynamics** for better song transitions.
